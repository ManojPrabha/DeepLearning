# Basics of Neural Network

## Neuron:
 A neuron forms the basic structure of a neural network. A neuron receives an input, processes it and generates an output which is either sent to other neurons for further processing or it is the final output.
 
## Weights:
 When input enters the neuron, it is multiplied by a weight. We initialize the weights randomly and these weights are updated during the model training process. The neural network after training assigns a higher weight to the input it considers more important as compared to the ones which are considered less important. A weight of zero denotes that the particular feature is insignificant.
 
## Bias:
 In addition to the weights, another linear component is applied to the input, called as the bias. It is added to the result of weight multiplication to the input. The bias is basically added to change the range of the weight multiplied input. After adding the bias, the result would look like a*W1+bias. This is the final linear component of the input transformation.
 
## Activation:
 The role of the Activation Function is to derive output from a set of input values fed to a node (or a layer). The primary role of the Activation Function is to transform the summed weighted input from the node into an output value to be fed to the next hidden layer or as output.
